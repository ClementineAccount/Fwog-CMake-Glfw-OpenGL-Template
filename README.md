# Fwog-CMake-Glfw-OpenGL-Template

## What is this?

This is an adaption of the original [Deccer's CMake-GLFW-OpenGL-Template](https://github.com/deccer/CMake-Glfw-OpenGL-Template) that comes with a [Fwog](https://github.com/JuanDiegoMontoya/Fwog) example scene featuring a textured cube. Fwog is a Low-level OpenGL 4.6 abstraction written in C++20.

## Why?

While Fwog comes with some [examples](https://github.com/JuanDiegoMontoya/Fwog/tree/main/example) of the abstraction used in practice, they are not designed to be used as templates and starting points for a user's own project. This template, however, allows you to start using the Fwog abstraction to make projects immediately with the same setup and libraries as included in Deccer's template.

## To Do

- Add camera control examples
- Add skybox example
- Add multiple cubes for the example scene (which also shows depth testing)
- Refactor DrawObject class
- (Maybe) Add Deccer's Cubes example that uses Fwog
