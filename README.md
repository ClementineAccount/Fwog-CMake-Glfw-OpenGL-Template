# Fwog-CMake-Glfw-OpenGL-Template

## What is this?

This is an adaption of the original [CMake-GLFW-OpenGL-Template](https://github.com/deccer/CMake-Glfw-OpenGL-Template) that comes with a [Fwog](https://github.com/JuanDiegoMontoya/Fwog) example... after I finish it though. I can't make the template private so... I'll just edit this part once its done
